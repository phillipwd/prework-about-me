      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I have worked quality assurance in machine shops for the last 5 years of work, but I have not been a machinist, which seems to be unusual.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Walla Walla, Washington.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy bowling and skiing. I run often and participate in races that I travel for.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Details here...</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I have been living North of Seattle in Lynnwood for the last two years</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>In my brief experience with coding, I found that I could get lost in it. I would work for hours without noticing the time go by. That really is what one would want with work.</p>
